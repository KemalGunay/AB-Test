# AB-Test

## Business Problem
A ...... company recently introduced a new bidding type, “average bidding”, as an alternative to its exisiting bidding type, called “maximum bidding”. One of our clients, --------.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.

In this A/B test, --------.com randomly splits its audience into two equally sized groups, e.g. the test and the control group. A --------- company ad campaign with “maximum bidding” is served to “control group” and another campaign with “average bidding” is served to the “test group”.

The A/B test has run for 1 month and --------.com now expects you to analyze and present the results of this A/B test.


You should answer the following questions in your presentation:
* How would you define the hypothesis of this A/B test?
* Can we conclude statistically significant results?
* Which statistical test did you use, and why?
* Based on your answer to Question 2, what would be your recommendation to client?
